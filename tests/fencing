# 3  Peer's disk state was already Inconsistent.
# 4  Peer's disk state was successfully set to Outdated
#    (or was Outdated tobegin with).
# 5  Connection to the peer node failed, peer could not be reached.
# 6  Peer refused to be outdated because the affected resource was in the
#    primary role.
# 7  Peer node was successfully fenced off the cluster.
#    This should never occur unless fencing is set to resource-and-stonith for
#    the affected resource.
