DRBD 9 Test Suite
=================

This is the beginning of a test suite for DRBD 9.  The test infrastructure
provided so far is not complete and the DRBD functionality covered by the tests
is quite minimal, but our goal is to build upon the existing components, and
add more infrastructure and tests in parallel to fixing any bugs that the tests
help to uncover.

Running the test suite requires the following components:

 * One test coordinator node.  The basic test infrastructure can be run as an
   unprivileged user.  (Access to virtual machine serial consoles requires
   sudo access as root though.)

 * Two or more nodes to use as the test cluster.  The nodes must be accessible
   over ssh without password prompt. (This is best configured by putting the
   ssh public key of the user running the test suite into
   ~root/.ssh/authorized_keys on each test node.)

 * The DRBD 9 kernel module and user-space utilities must be installed on all
   test nodes.

 * The exxe utility (http://git.drbd.org/exxe.git/) must be installed on the
   test coordinator and on all test nodes.  (This utility is used by the test
   coordinator for efficiently dispatching commands on the test nodes.)

 * The logscan utility (http://git.drbd.org/logscan.git/) must be installed on
   the test coordinator.

 * The server components of the test suite (directory server/) must be built
   once, and then installed on all test nodes (for example: "cd server && make"
   on the test coordinator, then mount the server/ directory on all test nodes
   and "make install" on each of them).

 * On each test node, all test volumes are currently created inside an LVM
   volume group called "scratch".  (The volume group name can be overridden
   with the --volume-group=<name> option.)


The tests are found in the client/ directory; they are relatively simple shell
scripts which take a number of parameters.  When invoked with a number of node
names as arguments, they will connect to all those test nodes via ssh and
execute various commands on them as defined by the test.  All the test results
are collected in the coordinator.  The coordinator is also where the test suite
checks for various DRBD state transitions to occur.  By default, each test run
is assigned a job name which consists of the base name of the test, with a
timestamp appended: the test-connect test would log into directory
connect-20131015-173644/, for example.  The following files can be found there:

  drbd.conf: the DRBD configuration file used on all nodes.

  events-<node-name>: The output of "drbdsetup events" on each node.  These
    event traces are used for checking for state transitions.

  test.log: The output of the test script (both standard output and standard
    error combined).

  <node-name>.log: The syslog of each node.

  exxe-<node-name>.log: The log of the exxe utility (all commands executed).

  *.pos: positions of the last match for logscan.

  console-<node-name>: the serial console output of each node (if the
    --console or --vconsole options are used).


The most important options supported by the test scripts are:

  --node=<node-name>  or just  <node-name>: The name of one of the test nodes.
    Depending on the test, one, two, or more nodes are required.

  --disk=<size>, --meta=<size>: Create a volume of the specified size on each
    test node.  If the --meta option is not used, the volumes are created with
    internal metadata; otherwise, the data and metadata are split.
  
  --verbose: Log more information while running the test.

  --debug: Include some information for debugging the test suite.

All --disk and --meta options specified before the first --node option apply to
all nodes.  Any --disk or --meta options specified after a --node option apply
only to that node.

In addition, the tests can be run with "bash -x" for a complete execution trace.


Virtual Machines

 * When testing virtual machines and logging their serial consoles, the virtual
   machine names must match the names under which the nodes are reachable via
   ssh.


Serial Consoles

 * Logging of serial console output is supported via the --console=/dev/...
   option.  The file permissions of that device must be set to allow read
   access to he user running the test suite.

 * Logging the serial console output of virtual machines running on the test
   coordinator is supported via the --vconsole option.  This requires that
   "sudo virsh" is permitted so that "sudo virsh ttyconsole <node-name>" can be
   used for finding out the pseudo-terminal that the serial console is attached
   to.  The file permissions of that device must be set to allow read access to
   the user running the test suite.  The name of the virtual machine must be
   the same as the name used for accessing the node via ssh.
