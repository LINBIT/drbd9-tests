* When cleaning up at the end of a test, report that we are cleaning up and
  report when cleaning up fails.

* register_cleanup():
  - Allow to specify a cleanup group.

* Implement quiet option for drbdmeta so that it doesn't report various crap
  on standard error.

* Human readable desctription of an entire test case

* Firewalling for tcp/udp syslog on the test node?!

* Implement a client-side cleanup script that cleans up a number of nodes

* When a test script fails, report where it failed (BASH_LINENO[]) ...

* Write some kind of end event into the syslog and events log and wait
  for these end markers to arrive to ensure that the syslog is complete.

* Set /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs small enough so that hung tasks
  will be reported in the syslog trace // otherwise dump all tasks when a test
  fails?

* Check for Oopses and warnings in the console and system logs.

* Check for states or state transitions which generally should not occur. (Will
  probably need to be turned off for tests checking for these states in
  particular.)

* Add iptables code for simulating slow or broken network connections or node
  failures (see the old test suite).

* Check for skipped events in the event log; that should not happen except in
  out-of-memory scenarios.

* Warn when the drbd module is initially loaded.

* Verbose test.log even when not verbose on the console.

* After one of the event commands has died, check and report if the reason was
  because the processes capturing the event stream has died.

* Verify disk contents at various stages (after resync, after writes).
  Use fio for that?

* Check how many blocks a resync has synced (roughly, to make sure drbd doesn't
  get things wrong completely).
