* When cleaning up at the end of a test, report that we are cleaning up and
  report when cleaning up fails.

* register_cleanup():
  - Allow to specify a cleanup group.

* Implement quiet option for drbdmeta so that it doesn't report various crap
  on standard error.

* Human readable desctription of an entire test case
* setup - cleanup: as soon as setup runs in a separate process, we cannot wait
  for setup's children with wait(2) anymore.

* Firewalling for tcp/udp syslog on the test node?!

* Implement a client-side cleanup script that cleans up a number of nodes

* When a test script fails, report where it failed (BASH_LINENO[]) ...

* Write some kind of end event into the syslog and events log and wait
  for these end markers to arrive to ensure that the syslog is complete.

* Write the test result into the log directory

* Removing the kernel module after a test sometimes reveals additional bugs;
  maybe we should do this by default.

* Run logscan inside the directory of the event traces to avoid directory names
  in the *.pos files.

* Set /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs small enough so that hung tasks
  will be reported in the syslog trace // otherwise dump all tasks when a test
  fails?

* Check for Oopses and warnings in the console and system logs.

* Check for states or state transitions which generally should not occur. (Will
  probably need to be turned off for tests checking for these states in
  particular.)
