* Create connections between nodes, wait for the connections to be established,
  create one or more volumes on the nodes.  In addition, the same scenario
  without waiting for the connections to be established.  (By default, drbdadm
  creates all volumes before establishing connections; make sure that creating
  the connections first works as well.)

* While a resource is doing application I/O, create another volume in that
  resource.
