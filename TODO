* If the IP address is not specified, use `gethostip -d "$host"'.
* Default port: 7789.
* Default volume group: "scratch".
* Default first minor number for the drbd device: 0

* Create the required number of test disks on each node, in the required size.
  Remember the device names (the devices can be for either data or metadata).
* Other options to set in the configuration file template?
* Instantiate the configuration file.
* Copy the configuration file to each node (with cleanup hook).

* register_cleanup():
  - Allow to specify a cleanup group.
  - Persistent vs. transient cleanup (things that go away at reboot).

* Template: support more than one volume.

* Implement quiet option for drbdmeta so that it doesn't report various crap
  on standard error.

* Human readable desctription of an entire test case
* setup - cleanup: as soon as setup runs in a separate process, we cannot wait
  for setup's children with wait(2) anymore.

* Firewalling for tcp/udp syslog on the test node?!

* Implement a register-cleanup script on the server (call register_cleanup).

* Implement a client-side cleanup script that cleans up a number of nodes

* events:
  -> Split off
  -> Allow logfiles to be missing => fall back to polling ...
